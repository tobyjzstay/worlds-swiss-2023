# Worlds 2023 Alternative Swiss Draw

With 5 intra-regional games in the second Swiss stage draw, I was curious about which matches would happen if teams could not be drawn against another team from the same region.

In addition, if the team results remained the same after the alternative second stage, what matches would happen in the third Swiss stage draw?

**REVISED FORMAT**

-   Teams are drawn into the bracket with 1st seeds playing 4th seeds and 2nd seeds playing 3rd seeds.

-   Teams from the same region are not able to play each other in rounds 1, 2, and 3 where possible.

-   Qualification and Elimination matches are best of three; all other matches are best of one.

Extending the draw restriction from round 1 to rounds 2 and 3, along with assuming teams are drawn in the same order, what would happen?

In the case where a draw would result in this scenario or would force this scenario in a future draw, the drawn team will move to the next available slot.

For example, JDG was drawn against BLG, but applying the draw restriction, BLG would have been placed in the third matchup. C9 would be matched against JDG, and LNG would be moved into the fourth matchup. Assuming GEN and T1 are drawn in the same order, they would face BLG and LNG respectively.
